Event & Club Management System
(Hackathon-Ready Explanation + Build Plan)
🎯 Goal (Simple Words)
Create a web-based system where:
Students (Participants) can register for events and see updates
Organizers (Admins) can create events, manage participants, and send announcements
No complex login, no payments — just clean core functionality.
1️⃣ System Overview (High Level)
Two roles
👤 Participant (User)
🛠 Admin (Organizer)
One shared system
Events
Registrations
Status tracking
Announcements
2️⃣ Participant Flow (User Side)
What a participant can do:
View available events
Register for an event
Check registration status
Pending
Confirmed
Rejected
Receive announcements
Event updates
Schedule changes
Important notices
Example Flow:
Copy code

User opens website
→ Sees list of events
→ Clicks "Register"
→ Status = Pending
→ Admin confirms
→ Status updates to Confirmed
→ User sees announcement
3️⃣ Admin Flow (Organizer Side)
What admin can do:
Create events
Title
Description
Date & venue
View registered participants
Update participant status
Pending → Confirmed / Rejected
Send announcements
Visible to all registered users
Example Flow:
Copy code

Admin logs in
→ Creates event
→ Views registrations
→ Confirms participants
→ Sends announcement
4️⃣ Suggested Tech Stack (Simple & Fast)
You can choose any, but this is hackathon-friendly:
Frontend
HTML + CSS + JavaScript
OR
React + Vite (recommended if you know React)
Backend
Node.js + Express
OR
Just mock backend using JSON (allowed)
Database (Optional)
Mock JSON data
OR SQLite / PostgreSQL
👉 Mock data is totally acceptable as per problem statement.
5️⃣ Database / Data Structure (Simple)
Event
Copy code
Json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "CodeSprint Hackathon",
  "date": "2026-02-10",
  "description": "One-day coding event"
}
Participant
Copy code
Json
{
  "id": 101,
  "name": "Aman",
  "email": "aman@gmail.com",
  "eventId": 1,
  "status": "pending"
}
Announcement
Copy code
Json
{
  "eventId": 1,
  "message": "Reporting time is 9 AM"
}
6️⃣ Pages / Screens to Build (Minimum)
Participant Pages
/events → View events
/register → Register
/status → Check status
/announcements → View updates
Admin Pages
/admin/events → Create/manage events
/admin/participants → View & update status
/admin/announcements → Send messages
⚠️ Authentication can be hardcoded:
/admin route = admin
/user route = participant
7️⃣ Demo Plan (Very Important for Hackathon)
During demo:
Show event creation (Admin)
Register user for event
Show status = Pending
Admin confirms user
Show updated status
Admin sends announcement
User receives announcement
This wins points because judges see complete flow.
8️⃣ What to Explain to Judges
Design Decisions
Simple role-based views
Status-based participant tracking
Mock data for speed
Future Improvements
Login & authentication
Email / WhatsApp notifications
QR-based attendance
Mobile app
Payment integration
